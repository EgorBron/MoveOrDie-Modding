# MoveOrDie-Modding

Hi! Welcome to the Move or Die modding tutorial!

## Important: it is still WIP!

It's still being written. I try to do the manual as soon as I have free time, but it is possible that it will be like other tutorials: it will be dropped and/or I won't be able to maintain it. So, I wait for your suggestions and contributions!

## Getting Started

Check out [mod structure](./ModStructure.md) before you get started. After creating an empty mod, you can go to any of the guides from the list below:

## Why is this?

Because the [official modding guide](http://moveordiegame.com/modding) hasn't been updated in a very long time, and it doesn't cover every possible type of mod. This guide will keep up with the updates, covering all possible (allowed) types of mods.
