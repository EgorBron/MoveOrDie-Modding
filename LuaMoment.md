# Confusing moment on Lua

As we know, the Move or Die game is made on awesome [**LÃ–VE framework**](https://github.com/love2d/love), which is a cool option to make games on Lua.

And that's another reason to call TAG as really awesome guys, because **we can *mod* totally everything**, including engine itself!

But now the bad news: **there's no actual API reference (and thus no modding guide)**.

> Yea, when you mess some time with Google (or etc.), you can find one [lone doc page by **Omar Shehata**](https://move-or-die.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) - big thanks to him.

> What about [**MoDev**](https://github.com/Rami-Sabbagh/MoDev)? Looks fresh and cool, and it also covers some articles that make sense!

> Nah, it archived 4 years ago! (but hm, did something changed in API from that moment? think nothing)

However, thoose RTD.io pages contain useful info that inspired to document MoD API.

**That's not violates the EULA, I read it carefully, and it's not forbidden to document the source (until I want to redistribute, but why).**

So, enjoy the [**Move or Die game engine API reference**](./ApiReference.md)!
